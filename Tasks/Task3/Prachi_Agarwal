A landing page is a page which the user/ advertisement viewer or visitor is able to view after clicking a search engine optimised output or advertisement,
and is different from the homepage as it contains not the way to view the whole website but focuses on the thing that brought the viewer to the website in the first place
and encouraging them to complete(join/shop/view, whatever services are offered by us) that task.

I think the call-to-action headline text is the most important aspect, and also the visual part. I am confused🙃

I like the Portfolio of Bruno-Simon cause it’s like so interactive in nature , like the visitor is engaged with it and that is something I didn’t see anywhere😬✨✨♥️

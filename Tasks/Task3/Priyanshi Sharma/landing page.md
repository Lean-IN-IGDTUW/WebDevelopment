1. The landing page is the page which is the result of clickable ads,the aim is to satisfy the needs of users because of which they visited our site. It is not the home page, it's like an advertisement of a company's website.
2. For me the most important aspect would be about the look of page i.e. how good and attractive the pages is, the color used.
3. I liked the cellag.org because it appears so smoothly. The color used and the they way it appears is so beautiful😍
